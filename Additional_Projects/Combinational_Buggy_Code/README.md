This doc contains a list of 3 walkthroughs I went through with the students during one of the discussions.
The main purpose of the discussion was to get student to become more proficient with waveform simulation tools (We used ModelSim).
THe first example was to show students how to used ModelSim customization options.
The 2 later examples contain buggy code that the students needed to fix up.
